# Hey there! 👋

Thanks for stopping by. Just a heads up, you won't find my game's source code here. This repo is a collection of strings i use for the Message of the Day (MOTD) and some other fun stuff related to my game.

Feel free to look around, and if you have any suggestions or you want me to upload anything, just comment!👍

Have a good day :)
